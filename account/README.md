# 😎 Account

The account created on install is the **admin account**, which can can be modified. Additional administrators can be also added.

## Granting Admin role

Users with role **Administrator** can grant admin access to other users.

💡 Grant admin access only to system administrators. If you need to grant moderation permissions use the **manager role**.

To grant administrator role to another user:

* Go to the **User profile**
* Click on **Edit**
* Select **Administrator** under user role
* Click on **Save changes**
